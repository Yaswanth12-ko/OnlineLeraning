    <h1>Cloud Computing Overview</h1>

    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services‚Äîsuch as storage, processing, networking, and analytics‚Äîover the internet (the cloud), allowing businesses and individuals to access data and applications from anywhere at any time.</p>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Key Components of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines and storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365).</li>
        <li><strong>Storage as a Service:</strong> Offers scalable storage solutions, including object storage, file storage, and block storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Refers to security measures implemented to protect data and applications in the cloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Networking:</strong> Refers to virtual networking components, including load balancers, virtual private networks (VPNs), and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Major Cloud Computing Providers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> The largest cloud provider, offering a vast range of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Azure:</strong> A comprehensive cloud platform offering solutions for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with a focus on enterprise applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong> Known for its machine learning, data analytics, and big data solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>IBM Cloud:</strong> A cloud platform offering IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with a focus on hybrid cloud and AI solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Oracle Cloud:</strong> Offers cloud services with a focus on database management systems and enterprise applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üöÄ Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reduces capital expenditures by moving infrastructure and applications to the cloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Allows for easy scaling of resources based on demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Offers a wide range of services that can be tailored to specific needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Many cloud providers offer robust security measures including encryption, multi-factor authentication, and compliance with global standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Provides access to applications and data from anywhere, using any device with an internet connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> Cloud providers often include disaster recovery and data backup as part of their service offerings.</li>
    </ul>
