    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think, learn, and solve problems. It is a rapidly growing field that spans various subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Key Areas of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A subset of AI where machines learn from data to make decisions and predictions without explicit programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A type of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in large datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Enabling machines to understand and interact with human language.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, like images and videos.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Designing intelligent robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> A type of ML where agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties.</li>
    </ul>
